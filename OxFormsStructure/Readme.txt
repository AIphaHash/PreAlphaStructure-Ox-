the idea of this project is a goverment emploey login with his account ( it can be added roles like some emploey have certin privilages)

after the emploey login he will tranform to the dashboard which have all the feautres that emploey can use and do
for example now from this pre alpha veriso he can do over a 7 tasks
----------
1-STATE OF THE HC : as it name it check the HC in the database that we have and show all the information about it 
with also if it is availible at this moment or not
-if it's not active the emploey can select it and check if there is a report attached to this HC to see what is the 
problem , if there is no report then the emploey will send a report to the higher emploey for example to send 
spacilist people to check why it is not active , if there is a report the emploey will check it and decide
what he can provide.
-at this moment there is two helps 1(assign more doctor if needed, let say in some HC eye docotr is needed alot 
so we can assing more eye doctor to this HC) 2(send medic ship , let say some HC have alot of a certin illnies 
that need a certin medic so we have to send it more of that medic)

2-ADD NEW HC : the emploey can add new HC by the given info from emploeys that their job to gather info about HCs
-after adding it to the database he can also use the (send medic ship , and assign doctors if needed)

3-DELETE HC : also can delete HC from the database (if it got close for example)

4-STORAGES CHECK : this is a big one it has alot of details, first of all the storages all attached to a certin HC
the emploey can check any storage to see how much space left , dose it have all the things that the storage need or
not 
-after that he can select a certin storage to go inside that stroage to see what does it have (see all the medics
info) and also there is two more forms first is num of medics which show a warrning if there is a medic that is 
about to get out of stock, and to check if there is medics that is about to get expired with differnt warrnings
(week and less , one mounth and less , etc..)
